# LtiAdvantage.AspNetCore

This library provides ASP.NET Core controller implementations to support platform development.
It targets `netstandard2.0` and uses BouncyCastle.NetCore to read and write PEM formatted keys
for compatibility with the [IMS LTI Reference Implementation](https://github.com/IMSGlobal/lti-reference-implementation).
